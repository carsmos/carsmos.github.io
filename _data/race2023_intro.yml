title1: 'Based on the autopilot middleware Dora and simulation platform Oasis of the Carsmos open source project,
        <br>it provides multiple predefined scenarios for participating teams in a simulation environment, 
        <br>and test the perception, planning, and decision-making abilities of the autonomous driving algorithms submitted by each team in various complex traffic environments within urban areas through different scenarios, 
        <br>planning and decision-making capabilities in various complex traffic environments in urban areas.
        <br>The winning teams of the simulation competition will be invited to participate in the offline vehicle challenge.'
