title: 'DORA - Dataflow Oriented Robotics Architecture'
description: 'DORA is an advanced open source autonomous driving and robot middleware framework and data flow computing platform.
The DORA project takes software-defined cars and intelligent driving as the target scenarios, integrates a large number of cloud-native architecture concepts and ecological tools,
and adopts the safe and reliable Rust language development, supports elastic data flow computing framework, diversified middleware selection
Cloud collaborative computing provides another more modern platform choice for the software development of smart cars,
and also provides a technical route for upgrading, replacing and surpassing ROS1/ROS2.'
