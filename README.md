# Special note for running/testing Jekyll themes locally on MacOS machine

The Ruby version preloaded in MacOS is v2.x, too low to run Jekyll.
The latest Ruby version 3.2.x is too high to Jekyll as well, with compaibility issues.
The best Ruby version to run Jekyll on your Mac is v3.1.x, e.g. 3.1.3.
