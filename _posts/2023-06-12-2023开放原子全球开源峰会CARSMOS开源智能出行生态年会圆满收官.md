On June 12th, the 2023 Open Atom Global Open Source Summit CARSMOS Open Source Smart Mobility Ecological Year was hosted by the Open Atom Open Source Foundation and undertaken by the CARSMOS Yuanao Open Source Intelligent Mobility Project Team. will be successfully held. Against the background of the explosion of autonomous driving and smart travel, this forum brings together a number of experts and scholars from the supply chain, industry-university-research circles, and corporate executives to share their latest theories, technologies and practical application results of open source technology in the field of smart travel. Discuss how to promote open source technologies in smart travel in colleges and universities, use the open source platform model to gather forces from industry, academia and research circles, and accelerate the development of autonomous driving and smart travel technologies and the landing of commercial products. Liu Jingjuan, deputy secretary-general of the Open Atom Open Source Foundation, attended and delivered a speech.

Liu Jingjuan said that open source will give the ability to effectively build a large and complex smart car software technology system, provide more possibilities for solving the supply chain security and technical route selection problems faced by the smart car industry, and will accelerate autonomous driving and smart travel. standardization process in the field. The foundation will fully empower the CARSMOS project, make the CARSMOS project bigger and stronger, and promote ecological prosperity. The foundation will inject strong impetus into the CARSMOS project by supporting development, promoting applications, providing technical reviews, and promoting community building.
