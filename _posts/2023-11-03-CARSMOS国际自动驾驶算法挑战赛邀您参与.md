## 1. Basic introduction to the CARSMOS Challenge


CARSMOS International Autonomous Driving Algorithm Challenge (hereinafter referred to as: CARSMOS Challenge) is the autonomous driving algorithm competition of the first Open Atomic Open Source Competition. It is hosted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the People's Government of Jiangsu Province, and the People's Government of Hunan Province, and is sponsored by the Open Atom Open Source Fund. Hosted by the OpenAtom Foundation, CCTV, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology, Wuxi Municipal People's Government, Jiangsu Software Industry Talent Development Foundation, Suzhou Industrial Park, Wuxi High-tech Zone, etc., CARSMOS Yuanyao Open Source under the Open Atom Open Source Foundation The core units of the smart travel project team are Synkrotron Technologies and Futurewei. Technical supporters of the competition include the internationally renowned autonomous driving open source simulation community CARLA, Shanghai AI Laboratory, Tsinghua Mars Lab, OpenEV, etc.

The CARSMOS Challenge is open to the world. Excellent teams and players from domestic and foreign universities, research institutes, open source organizations, and industry organizations can register to participate. The challenge is an online competition, and the CARSMOS open source code repository (https://github.com/carsmos) is provided as a baseline reference design and implementation (not a mandatory condition).

The competition is based on a simulation environment, providing participating teams with multiple predefined training scenarios for learning and debugging, and then using more complex test scenarios to evaluate and compete each participating team's autonomous driving algorithm in various complex traffic environments on highways and urban areas. perception, planning and decision-making abilities. The online competition will be ranked according to the online rankings, and the winning team will participate in the final online review meeting to determine the final winner.


# 1.1 Open registration and online exercise development/training (August 2023-November 30, 2023)


Open registration and online exercise development/training: Users sign up, become familiar with the development and submission environment, and through online learning and training, can use the autonomous driving simulation platform Oasis and Oasis provided by the CARSMOS open source intelligent driving project (code repository: AtomGit) The middleware Dora is used to quickly develop a complete set of autonomous driving algorithms and can submit the algorithm to the system platform. At this stage, public training scenarios are used and no ranking is performed.


# 1.2 Official online ranking competition (October 2023-December 31, 2023)


Formal online ranking competition: multiple predefined scenarios are provided in a simulation environment to test the perception, planning and decision-making capabilities of each participating team's autonomous driving algorithm in various complex traffic environments. The scoring rules are transparent, and the algorithm competition platform automatically scores. At this stage, non-public test scenarios are used, and the list is made public.


# 1.3 Defense and Award Stage (January 2024, specific time to be determined)


During the defense and award stage, 1st, 2nd, 3rd prizes and excellence awards will be selected, and an award ceremony will be held; the winning team will receive generous rewards from the foundation and related internship and job opportunities.


# 1.4 Highlights of the competition


1) Algorithm Open Source – Among the global autonomous driving competitions, the CARSMOS Challenge is the only open source challenge, which requires participating teams to open source their algorithms within 3 months, which will help future generations continue to improve and make the competition stronger and stronger.

2) The competition is of high standard – hosted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the People’s Government of Jiangsu Province and the People’s Government of Hunan Province.

3) Low entry barrier – CARSMOS has provided a very modular benchmark design, which is very convenient for participating teams to replace any operator module or subsystem to test their innovative algorithms.

4) Large talent reserve – The CARSMOS Challenge aims to attract and train college students/graduate students to enter the field of autonomous driving and cultivate a large number of reserve talents. The winners are outstanding engineers and future leaders that leading companies are competing to recruit.
