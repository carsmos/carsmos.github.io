Up to now, more than 30 open source projects have passed the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) technical access, covering operating systems, storage, security, middleware, cloud native, supercomputing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, open source hardware, industrial software 12 key areas, such as browser kernel, and font standard, initially realized the synergy and symbiosis of "storage, defense, cloud, computing, core, software, hardware, and terminal".

In the future, the foundation will give full play to the role of the organizer and promoter of the open source ecosystem, gather developers, and cultivate open source projects. On the one hand, strengthen the construction of open source infrastructure. With the goal of serving global developers, we will cooperate with leading companies and research institutions to create a neutral, public welfare, and inclusive code hosting platform, which will gather developer resources, empower developers, and empower open source projects. In the future, the foundation will hold more developer activities and conferences, strengthen various developer services, reach and influence developers on a wider scale, and encourage more developers to participate in community contributions.

On the other hand, incubate and cultivate influential open source projects. Accelerate the deployment of open source in key areas, further improve the development system of open source projects, reserve open source projects in key areas such as chips, artificial intelligence, databases, big data, Internet of Things, and industrial software, and accelerate the attraction of more donors and outstanding open source projects to join the foundation. The foundation will organize and coordinate all parties, actively participate in and support the project community and ecological construction, actively promote my country's excellent open source projects to go out from a global perspective, and jointly build and govern with international open source forces, while realizing commercial value.
